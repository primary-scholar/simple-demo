/**
 * 两个无环链表 求相交的首节点
 * <p>
 * Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.
 * <p>
 * For example, the following two linked lists:
 * <p>
 * * A:          a1 → a2
 * *                       ↘
 * *                         c1 → c2 → c3
 * *                       ↗
 * * B:     b1 → b2 → b3
 * begin to intersect at node c1.
 * <p>
 * Notes:
 * <p>
 * If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
 * The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
 * You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
 * Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.、
 * <p>
 * 要求 内存空间 O(1) 所以 只能在原链表上 进行查找
